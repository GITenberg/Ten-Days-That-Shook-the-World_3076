description: This book is the author's eyewitness account of the Russian Revolution.
  Writing in the first flush of revolutionary enthusiasm, he gives a gripping account
  of the events in Petrograd in November 1917, when Lenin and the Bolsheviks finally
  seized power. Containing verbatim reports both of speeches by leaders and of the
  chance comments of bystanders, and set against an idealized backdrop of soldiers,
  sailors, peasants, and the proletariat uniting to throw off oppression, his account
  is the product of passionate involvement and remains an unsurpassed classic of reporting.
